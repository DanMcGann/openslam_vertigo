# Vertigo (GTSAM4)                        
Versatile Extensions for RobusT Inference using Graph Optimization
====================================================================

The following is a stripped down version of the original 
[vertigo package](https://github.com/OpenSLAM-org/openslam_vertigo).
Specifically, this package maintains only the GTSAM compatible 
implementation of Switchable constraints, that as been updated for GTSAM 4.

Additionally, the package's build system has been updated to match modern (at time of writing) cmake practices.
